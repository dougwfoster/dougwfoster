I am an embedded software engineer with 5+ years of experience developing and testing embedded software, primarily on microcontrollers. My expertise includes various low power wireless protocols, but I am highly interested in anyhthing related to embedded connectivity. Iâ€™m currently working on getting more familiar with open source real-time operating systems (RTOS) and networking.
