I am a software engineer with 6+ years of experience, primarily developing and testing embedded software on microcontrollers. However, my expertise includes networking software and various low power wireless protocols. I am highly interested in anyhthing related to embedded systems, networking, or connectivity. Iâ€™m currently working on getting more familiar with open source real-time operating systems (RTOS).
